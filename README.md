# CovidTracker
# Author: Avinash Koya

With rising Covid-19 cases in the world, I was inspired to write a program which allows the user to input data regarding the number of cases.
The program is a simple way to input data and compare individual statistics versus population statistics

The main work is all done in one java file, namely COVIDTracker.java; it can be used in any platform with up to date java compilers

COVIDTrackerTester is where the test cases are located. It is included to show the functionality of the program.
